# 🌿 Eco-Fi AI – Smart Ticket Triage Dashboard

**Eco-Fi AI** is an intelligent, AI-powered dashboard designed to transform how engineering and operations teams **triage**, **analyze**, and **resolve issue tickets**. By leveraging **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Machine Learning**, and powerful **data visualizations**, it enhances decision-making and drastically reduces resolution times.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

Engineering teams often spend **countless hours** manually:
- Triaging tickets
- Analyzing logs
- Searching historical issues in Jira, ServiceNow, etc.

This leads to:
- **Loss of tribal knowledge**
- **Delayed resolution of critical tickets**
- **Significant inefficiencies**

## 💡 What Eco-Fi AI Does

### 🤖 AI-Powered Ticket Triage
- Suggests the best owner/team using **BERT**
- Fetches similar past tickets
- Estimates resolution time

### 🧊 Dead Ticket Detection
- Flags inactive tickets using ML classifiers
- Detects based on timestamps, comments & activity

### 🚨 Impact-Based Prioritization
- Classifies urgency using NLP
- Highlights high-impact tickets based on affected systems

### 📊 Dynamic Visual Dashboards
- Visualizes ticket lifecycle with **heatmaps**, **pie charts**, and **state breakdowns** using **Power BI** or **Chart.js**
